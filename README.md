// Asking Questions Endpoint
// The user gives two inputs and the 
// program uses those inputs to ask questions
// Peer Reviewed by: Reed Goodwin- Well written code! I like the way it shows the question asked so the user has some idea of what is going on!
// "I wrote the questions in the url bar before I handed the computer to Reed lol My bad ^" - Jacob
